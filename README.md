# GentleMachinesHydroWifiController
This repository hosts the code for the Gentle Machines Hydro Controller, engineered to automate and optimize indoor hydroponic systems like AeroGardens and Rise Gardens. Our aim is to enhance growth rates and simplify the maintenance process, making it easier than ever to grow your own indoor garden.

We designed a simple case we would recommend printing in a clear PLA.
